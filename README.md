# BoardNite!

BoardNite is a single page app that allows you to keep track of player scores for your favorite boardgames! It allows you to see the players you played with for each game, their wins and how many times they were fighting for justice or hatching sinister plans like a bad apple.

If you ever forget the minimum or maximum players, rules in general or wanted to see how much it retails for, dont worry! Clicking the title will remind you of those and even link to the official sites and rulebook.

### Quick Example

With a super tight time constraint, authentication was not implemented but may be done in the future. Another future feature may be the unfinished search bar with the idea that it will allow users to search for their favorite game data not already available and add it to their list of games on the left. It would check the database to validate if game data is already present, if not it would hit a board game aggregator API for the game data and save it into the database to improve query speeds.
